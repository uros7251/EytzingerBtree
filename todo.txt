altan's notes:
 - focus on eytzinger n-ary layout 

implemented:
 - hot path inlined
 - move allocate/deallocate logic to segment class (?)
 - use assertions instead of exceptions
 - avoid code repetition in lower_bound (?)
 - use of RAII for fix/unfix page
 - fast insertions

left to be implemented:
 - optimistic lock coupling
 - n-ary eytzinger
 - leverage simd (requires allignment)

challanges:
 - different key types (different allignment, comparison logic, etc.)
 - idea for strings: store the first few bytes along with the pointer for faster comparison

for later:
 - try to add next_node pointers to leaf nodes while taking into account buffer manager based on pointer swizzling

questions for altan:
 - take a look at results (why are they not better)
 - c++ help, node operations are written in terms of iterators. the only thing that should be changed between
different layouts is iterator implementation and lower_bound implementation. how to do that?


gcc bug:
 - inner_node.h:418 segmentation fault on _mm512_set1_epi64()
 - details:doesn't happen only in release mode when i run all the tests (when i run just eytzinger tests, it appears again)
store instruction is problematic. clang produces no bug.
