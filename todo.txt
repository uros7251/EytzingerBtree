use optimistic lock coupling, currently using classical lock coupling (with mutexes)
implement inner nodes with eytzinger layout
use simd

for later:
try to add next_node pointers to leaf nodes while taking into account buffer manager based on pointer swizzling

altan's notes:

implemented:
 - hot path inlined
 - move allocate/deallocate logic to segment class (?)
 - use assertions instead of exceptions
 - avoid code repetition in lower_bound (?)
 - no problem in merge
 - use of RAII for fix/unfix page

left to be implemented:
 - optimistic lock coupling
 - fast insertions
